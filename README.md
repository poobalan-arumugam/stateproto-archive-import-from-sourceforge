# stateproto-archive-import-from-sourceforge
StateProto imported from sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/stateproto/

This is an old project I worked on a long time ago.
I plan to update this project but wanted an initial archive repo
to track the original artifacts - before making a git source repo from it.
